               <p>THere are within the realme of England two noble &amp; famous Vniuerſities, wher<g

                  Quéenes, Biſhops, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and Ladies, of the lande:
                  but alſo large liuinges and great reuenues beſtowed vpon them (the lyke wherof is
                  not to be ſéene in any other region as <hi rend="plain">Peter Martyr</hi> dyd oft affirme) to

                  two that of Oxforde (which lyeth weſt and by North from London) ſtandeth moſt
                  pleaſauntly of both, being enuironned in maner rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"

                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were remooued, as greatly annoy the ſame. That of

                  ſupplyed with gall, and ſea coole, wherof they haue great plenty lead thither by

                  Cambridge: and therevnto the ſtréetes of the towne for the moſt part more large

                  ſo déere vnto me, as that I can not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily tell, vnto
                  whyther of them I owe the moſt good wyll. Woulde to God my know<g

               <p>THe greateſt parte of our buylding in the cities and good townes of Englande
                  conſiſteth onely of timber, for as yet fewe of the houſes of the comminalty
                  (except here &amp; there in the weſt country townes) are made of ſtone, although
                  they may in my opinion in diuers other places be builded ſo good cheape of the one
                  as of the other. In olde tyme the houſes of the Brytons were ſlitely ſet vppe with
                  a few poſtes and many radles, the like whereof almoſt is to be ſéene in the fenny
                  countries vnto this day, where for lacke of wood they are inforced to continue
                  this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient maner of buylding. It is not in vayne
                  therefore in ſpeaking of buylding to make a diſtinction betweene the playne and
                  wooddye countrie, for as in theſe, our houſes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"

                  they are inforced for want of ſtuffe to vſe no ſtuddes at all, but only ray<g

                  whereunto they faſten their Splintes or radles, and then caſt it all ouer wyth

               <p>THere are as I take it, few great townes in England, that haue not their weekely
                  Markets, in which al maner of prouiſion for houſhold, is to be bought and ſoulde,
                  for eaſe and benefite of the countrey rounde about, wherby as it commeth to paſſe
                  that no buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall make any great iourney in the pur<g

                  in many places to to much abuſed: for the relief and eſe of the buyer, is not ſo

               <p>I coulde if I woulde exemplifie in many, but I will touch no one particularly.
                  Certes it is rare to ſée in any market the aſſize of breade well kept according to

                  to be vſed as occaſion ſhall compell me. But to procéede with my purpoſe. Before

                  &amp; this I find to be confirmed by authours. There is a Well in the forreſt of

               <p>In the paryſhe of Landſarnam in wales, and in the ſide of a ſtony hil, is a place

                  As for the huge ſtone that lyeth at Pember, in Guythery pariſh, and of the notable
                  carkas that is affirmed to lye vnder the ſame, there is no cauſe to touch it here,
                  yet were it well done to haue it remooued though it were but onely to ſée what it
                  is, which the people haue in ſo greeat eſtimation &amp; reuerence. There is alſo a

                  they dye without recouerye. There is alſo a Linne in Wales, which in the one ſide
                  beareth trowtes ſo redde as ſamons, and on the other which is the weſterlye ſide,

               <p>There is a Well not farre from ſtonye Stratforde, which conuerteth many things
                  into the ſtone, and another in Wales, which is ſayde to double or trible, the

                  wherof doth bréede a very odoriferous and delectable moſſe, wherewith the heade of
                  the ſmeller is marueylouſlye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed. Other Welles we
                  haue lykewiſe, which at ſome times burſt out into huge ſtreames, though at other
                  ſeaſons they run but very ſoftly, whereby the people gather ſome alteratio<g
                     ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of eſtate to be at hand. Some of the greater
                  ſort alſo giue ouer to runne at all in ſuch times, whereof they conceyue the like
                  opinion. What the fooliſh people dreame of the hell Kettles, it is not worthy the

                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of them, maye growe into contempt, I will ſay thus
                  much alſo of thoſe pits. Ther are certeine pittes or rather thrée litle poles, a
                  myle from Darlington, and a quarter of a myle diſtant from the Theſe bankes, which
                     y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people call the Kettes of hell, or the deuils Ketteles,
                  as if he ſhoulde ſée the ſoules of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men and women
                  in them: they adde alſo that the ſpirites haue oft béene harde to crye and yell
                  about them, wyth other like talke ſauouring altogether of pagane infidelitye. The
                  truth is (&amp; of this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo was Cuth<g
                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Tunſtall Byſhop of Durham) that the <pb n="94"
                     /> Colemines, in thoſe places are kindled or if there be no
                  coles, there may a mine of ſome other vnctuous matter be ſet on fire, which beyng
                  here and there conſumed, the earth falleth in, and ſo doth leaue a pitte. In déede
                  the water is nowe and then warme as they ſaye, and beſide that it is not cléere,
                  the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuppoſe them to be an hundred faddame déepe,
                  the byggeſt of them alſo hath an iſſue into the Theſe. But ynough of theſe woon<g

                  &amp; thus much of the hel Kettles.</p>
               <p>There is a Well in Darby ſhyre, called Tiddeſwell, whoſe water often ſéemeth to
                  ryſe and fall, as the Sea which is fortye mile from it: doth vſually accuſtome to
                  ebbe and flowe, and hereof an opinion is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that it
                  kéepeth an ordinary courſe, as the ſea doth, howbeit ſith dyuers are knowne to
                  haue watched the ſame, it may be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at ſome<g
                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ryſeth but not continually, and that it ſo doth
                  I am fullye perſwaded to beléeue. But ynough of the woonders leſt I do ſéeme by
                  talking longer of them, woonderouſlye to ouerſhoote my ſelfe, and forget howe much
                  doth reſt behynde of the dyſcription of my countrey.</p>
