         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the
               publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the
               image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database
               (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy
               (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published
               between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project
               restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic
               transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural
               encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
               Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January
               2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we
               respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original
               source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any
               assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature
               (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then
               their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide
               variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the
               period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although
               there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and
               sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling
               reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic
               encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and
               Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for
               accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be
               redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters
               marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per
               text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these
               processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good,
               some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible.
               Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been
               looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the
               TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with
               mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters
               represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML
               (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  and sayde.</p>
               <p>O Lorde, almightie and euerlasting God, I giue thee most harty tha<g
                     ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks, that thou hast bin so mercifull vnto me, as
                  to spare me to beholde this ioyfull day. And I acknowledge that thou hast delt as
                  wonderfully and as mercifully with me, as thou diddest with thy true and faythfull
                  seruant Daniell thy Prophete, whom thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueredst out
                  of the denne from the crueltie of the greedie and raging Lions: euen so was I o<g

                  onely be thankes, honor and praise, foreuer. Amen.</p>
               <p>The second was the receyuing of the Bible at the little conduit in Cheape. For
                  when hir Grace had learned that the Byble in Englishe should there be offred, she
                  thanked the Citie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, promised the reading thereof
                  most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and incontinent commaunded, that it
                  shoulde be brought. At the receyte whereof, how reuerently did she with both hir
                  handes take it, kisse it, and lay it vpon hir breast? to the great comfort of the
                  lookers on. God will vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly preserue so worthie a
                  Prince, which at his honor so reuerently taketh hir beginning. For this saying is
                  true, and written in the Booke of truth. He that first seeketh the kingdome of

                  for the good zeale and care that you seeme to have as well towarde mee, as to the
                  whole estate of your Countrey. Your petition I gather to be grounded on three
                     cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and mine answere to the same shall con<g
                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in two partes. And for the first I say vnto you,
                  that from my yeares of vnderstanding, knowing my selfe a seruitour of almightie
                  God, I chose this kind of life, in which I doe yet liue, as a life most acceptable
                  vnto him, wherein I thought I coulde best serue him, and with most quietnesse doe
                  my duetie vnto him. From which my choise, if either ambition of high estate offred
                  vnto me by mariages (whereof I have recordes in this presence) the displeasure of
                  the Prince, the eschewing the daunger of mine enimies, or the auoyding the perill
                  of death (whose Messenger the Princesse indignation was no little tyme continually
                  present before mine eyes, by whose meanes, if I knew or do iustly suspect, I will
                  not now vtter them, or if the whole cause were my sister hirselfe, I will not nowe
                  charge the deade) coulde have drawne or disswaded me, I had not nowe remayned in
                  this Virgins estate wherein you see me. But so constant have I al<g
                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continued in this my determination (that although my
                  wordes and youth may seeme to some hardly to agree togither) yet it is true, that
                  to this day I stande free from any other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that
                  eyther I have had in tymes past, or have at this present. In which state and trade
                  of liuing wherwith I am so throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God hath
                  hitherto so preserued mee, and hath so watchfull an eye vpon me, and so hath
                  guided me and ledde me by the hand, as my full trust is, he will not suffer me to
                  go alone. The maner of your petition I doe lyke, and take in good part, for it is
                  simple, and conteyneth no ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of place or person.
                  If it had bene other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I must have mislyked it verie
                  much, and thought in you a verie great presumption, being vnfitte and altogither
                  vnmeete, to require them that may commaunde, or those appoynt, whose partes are to
                  desire, or such to binde and limitte, whose dueties are to obey: or to take vpon
                  you to draw my loue to your lykings, or to frame my wil to your fancies. A guerdon
                  constrayned, and a gift freely giuen can neuer agree. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"

                  it may please god to incline my heart to that kinde of life, my meaning is to do

                  />ten, and so onely recyted out of the Booke, sayde theyr booke was not readie

                  Counsayle somewhat straunge, and yet was it permytted wythoute any greate
                  reprehension, bycause they excused themselues with mistaking the order, and agreed
                  that they would not fayle but put it in writing, &amp; according to the former

                  to be sayde: and they sayde no. So as then the other parte was lycenced to shewe
                  theyr myndes, which they did according to the first order, exhibiting all that
                  whiche they mente <pb n="1800"/> to bee propounde in a Booke written, which after
                  a prayer and inuocation made most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Almightie
                  God, for the enduing of them wyth hys holy spirite, and a protestation also to

                  the doctrine of the Prophetes and the Apostles: was distinctly read by one Robert

                  the same beeing ended wyth some likelyhoode, as it seemed <milestone

                  allowable to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: certaine of the Bishoppes
                  began to saye contrarie to their former answere, that they had nowe muche more to

                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that which they had to say: It was both ordered,
                  and thus openlye agreed vppon of both <milestone type="tcpmilestone"
                     unit="unspecified" n="20"/> partes in the full audience, that vpon the Mon<g

                  first reade the same, and that done, the other parte shoulde bring likewise theyrs
                  to the same. And being read, eche of them shoulde deliuer to other the same
                  wrytings. And in the meane tyme the Bishops should put in writing, not onely al
                  that which Doctour Cole had that day vttered: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone"
                     unit="unspecified" n="30"/> all suche other matters as they anye otherwise

                  part, and they shoulde receyue of them that wryting which Maister Horne had there

                  day they shoulde exhibite their aunswers touching the first proposition. Thus both
                  partes assented thereto, and the assemblie quietly dismissed. And there<g

                  Bishop of Winchester and his Colleages, and especially Lyncolne, refused to

                  they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> being first
                  gentlye and fauourably requyred to keepe the order appoynted: and that taking no
                  place, bring secondly as it behoued, pressed with more earnest request: they

                  And immediately by the commandement of the Queenes highnesse, hir priuie
                  counsaile, tooke order that six Citizens of London, and two of the Clergie of the

                  the same were couered with bourdes and leade, after the maner of a false roufe.
                  And the greatnesse of the worke dispatched in so short tyme coulde fearcely bee
                  credited of any, but of such as saw and knewe the same. And the cause of this
                  great hall was for feare of raine, whiche might have perished the vawtes, to the
                     destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Churche, and the people that

                  lead and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finished. And the same yeare also, the
