         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the
               publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the
               image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database
               (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy
               (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published
               between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project
               restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic
               transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural
               encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
               Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January
               2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we
               respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original
               source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any
               assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature
               (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then
               their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide
               variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the
               period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although
               there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and
               sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling
               reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic
               encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and
               Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for
               accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be
               redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters
               marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per
               text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these
               processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good,
               some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible.
               Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been
               looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the
               TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with
               mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters
               represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML
               (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  woulde ſuffer. One helpe, and none of the ſmalleſt that I obtayned herein was by
                  ſuch commentaries as <hi rend="text">Leland</hi> had collected ſometime of the
                  ſtate of Britaine, bookes vtterly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, defaced with
                  wet, and weather, and finally imperfite through want of ſundrie volumes ſecondly,
                  I gate ſome knowledge of things by letters and pamphlettes, from ſundrie places
                  and shires of Englande, but ſo diſcordaunt nowe and then amongeſt themſelues,
                  eſpecially in the names and courſes of riuers and ſcituation of townes, that I had
                  oft greater trouble to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them, then to penne the
                  whole diſcourſe of ſuch pointes as they contayned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
                  thirde ayde did grow by conference with diuers, eyther at the table or ſecretly
                  alone, wherein I marked in what things the talkers did agree, and wherein they
                  impugned eche other, chooſing in the end the former, and reiecting the later, as
                  one deſirous to ſet forth the truth abſolutely, or ſuch things in deede as were
                  moſt likely to be true. The laſt comfort aroſe by mine owne reading of ſuch
                  writers as haue heretofore made mention of the condition of our country, in
                  ſpeaking whereof, yf I shoulde make account of the ſucceſſe, and extraordinary
                  comming by ſundrie treatizes not ſuppoſed to be extaunt, I shoulde but ſeeme to
                  pronounce more then may well be ſayde with modeſtie, and ſay farder of myſelfe
                  then this Treatize can beare witneſſe of. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I
                  referre not this ſucceſſe wholly vnto my purpoſe in this Deſcription, but rather
                  giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof to come to paſſe in the penning of my
                  Chronologie, whoſe cromes as it were fell out very well in the framing of this
                  Pamphlete. In the proceſſe therefore of this Booke, if your Ho<g
                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour regarde the ſubstaunce of that which is here
                  declared, I muſt needes confeſſe that it is none of mine: but if your Lordshippe
                  haue conſideration of the barbarous compoſition shewed
                  <!--<pb facs="tcp:29044:9"/>--> herein, that I may boldely clayme and chalenge for
                  myne owne, ſith there is no man of any ſo ſlender skill, that will defraude me of
                  that reproche, which is due vnto me, for the meere negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"
                  />gence, diſorder, and euill diſpoſition of matter, comprehended in the ſame.
                  Certes I proteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and your Honour, that I neuer
                  made any choiſe of ſtile, or picked wordes, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"
                  />garded to handle this Treatize in ſuch preciſe order and methode as many other
                  woulde: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it ſufficient, truely &amp; plainly to
                  ſet forth ſuch things as I minded to intreate of, rather then with vaine
                  affectation of eloquence to paint out a rotten ſepulchre, neither co<g
                     ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable in a writer nor profitable to the
                  reader. How other affayres troubled me in the writing hereof many know, &amp;
                  peraduenture the ſlackeneſſe shewed herein can better teſtifie: but howſoeuer it
                  be done, &amp; whatſoeuer I haue done, I haue had an eſpeciall eye vnto the truth
                  of things, &amp; for the reaſt, I hope that this foule frizeled Treatize of mine,
                  will prooue a ſpurre to others, better learned in more skilfull maner to handle
                  the ſelfe ſame argument. As for faultes eſcaped here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as
                  there are diuers, I muſt needes confeſſe, both in the penning and printing, ſo I
                  haue to craue pardon of your Honour, &amp; of all the learned readers. For ſuch
                  was my shortneſſe of time allowed in the writing, &amp; ſo great the ſpeede made
                  in the Printing, that I could ſeldome with any deliberation peruſe, or almoſt with
                  any iudgement deliberate exactly vpon ſuch notes as were to be inſerted. Sometimes
                  in deede their leyſure gaue me libertie, but that I applyed in following my
                  vocation, many times their expedition abridged my peruſall, and by this later it
                  came to paſſe, that moſt of this booke was no ſooner penned then printed, neither
                  well concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before it came to writing. But it is now
                  to late to excuſe the maner of doing. It is poſsible that your Honour will miſtyke
                  hereof, for that I haue not by myne owne trauaile and eyeſight viewed ſuch
                  thinges, as I doe here intreate of. In deede I muſt needes confeſſe that except it
                  were from the parish where I dwell, vnto your Honour in Kent, or out of London
                  where I was borne, vnto Oxforde and Cambridge where I haue beene brought vp, I
                  neuer trauailed 40 miles in all my lyfe, neuertheleſſe in my report of theſe
                  thinges, I vſe their authorities, who haue performed in their perſons whatſoeuer
                  is wanting in mine. It may be in like ſort that your Honour will take offence at
                  my rashe and rechleſſe behauiour vſed in the compoſition of this volume, and much
                  more that being ſcambled vp after this maner, I dare preſume to make ten<g
                     ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doure of the protection thereof vnto your Lordships

                  that your Ho. doth beare to thoſe that in any wiſe will trauaile to ſet forth ſuch
                  things as lye hidden of their countries, without regarde of fine &amp; eloquent
                  handling, &amp; therinto do weigh on mine owne behalfe my bounden duetie and
                  gratefull minde to ſuch a one as hath ſo many and ſundrie wayes profited and
                  preferred me, that otherwiſe can make no recompence, I can not but cut of all ſuch
                  occaſion of doubt, and therevpon exhibite it ſuch as it is, and ſo pen<g

                  it may ſeeme in any wyſe acceptable, I haue my whole deſire. And as I am the firſt

                  ſhal there be opened at large, the onely occaſion of this deuiſion growyng vpon
                  hope of inſtruction to come in tyme, whereof when I had moſt néede, and the lefe
                  vnder the preſſe, I was left deſtitute and without hope of all reliefe. It is
                  poſſible, that ſome curious head may finde carpyng worke inough in y<hi rend="sup"

                  and try what one man can doe by reading onely, (for I ſayled about my country
                  within the compaſſe of my ſtudy) &amp; therunto remember how many wais, through
                  many mens iudge mentes, and what number of occaſions may ſerue here and there, to
                  inforce the writer to miſtake his Pamphlets, quarters, townes, entraunces, &amp;c.
                  I doe not doubt but it woulde trouble his brayn, although now peradue<g

                  he doth that ſitteth at home among Ladies and Gentlewomen, and will talke and take
                  order for matters abroad that are to be done in the field, where he neuer ſhewed
                  his face. Vnto the learned therfore, I yeld correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke"

                  their gentle and brotherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, they ſhall be the
                  ſooner amended. Furthermore, this I haue alſo to remember that in the courſes of
                  our ſtreames, I regard not ſo much to name y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very town or

                  towne, I thinke my duety diſcharged, if I hitte vpon any part or parcel of the

               <p>Firſt of all, I finde that Dunwallon King of Britayne, about 483. yeares before

                  traueiled too and fro, and being willing (ſo much as in him laye) to redreſſe
                  theſe inconueniences, cauſed his whole kingdome to be ſurueyed, and then
                  commaunding foure principall wayes to be made, which ſhoulde leade ſuch as
                  traueyled into all partes thereof, from ſea to ſea, he gaue ſundry large
                  priuileges vnto the ſame, whereby they became ſafe, and verye much frequented. And
                  as he had regarde herein, to the ſecuritie of hys Subiectes, ſo he made ſharp
                  lawes, grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iuſtice, for y<hi rend="sup"
