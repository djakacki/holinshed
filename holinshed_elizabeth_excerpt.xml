            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But after that hir grace had vnderſtoode the meaning thereof, ſhee thanked the Citie, prayſed the faireneſſe of the worke, and promiſed that ſhee would do hyr whole endeuour, for the continuall preſeruation of concord, as the Pageante did importe.

                        <p>The Queenes Maieſtie when ſhe had heard the childe, and vnderſtoode the Pageant at full, gaue the Citie alſo thankes there, and moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly promiſed hir good endeuour for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the ſaide vertues, and ſuppreſſion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> vices, and ſo marched on, till ſhe came agaynſte the great conduit in Cheape, whiche was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with pictures and ſentences accordingly, againſt hir graces comming thither.</p>
                        <p>Againſt Soper lanes ende was extended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one ſide of the ſtreete to the other, a Pageant which had three gates all open.

                        <p>In the forefront of this Pageant, before the children which did repreſent the bleſſings, was a conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtanding caſt out for a child to ſtand, which did expound the ſayd Pageante vnto the Queenes Maieſtie, as was done in the other tofore. Euery of theſe children were appointed &amp; apparelled, according vnto the bleſſing which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> hee dyd repreſent. And on the foreparte of the ſayde Pageaunte, was written in faire letters the name of the ſayde Pageant in this manner following.</p>
                        <q>The eight beatitudes expreſſed in the fifth Chapter of the Goſpell of Sainte Mathew, applyed to oure ſoueraigne Lady Queene Elizabeth.</q>
                        <p>Ouer the two ſide portes was placed a noiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of inſtruments.

                        <p>Before that the Queenes highnes came vnto this Pageaunte, ſhee required the matter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be opened vnto hir, that hir grace might the better vnderſtand, what ſhould afterwarde by the child be ſayde vnto hir.

And it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> tolde hir grace, that there was placed Tyme. Tyme? quoth ſhee, and Tyme hath broughte me hither. And ſo forth the whole matter was opened to hir grace, as heereafter ſhall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the deſcription of the Pageant. But in the opening, when hir grace vnderſtoode that the Byble in Engliſhe ſhoulde be deliuered vnto hir by Trueth, which was therin repreſented by a childe: ſhe thanked the Citie for that gift, and ſayd, that ſhe would oftentimes reade ouer that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Booke, commaunding Sir Iohn Parrat, one of the Knights which helde vp hir Canapie, to goe before, and to receiue the Booke. But lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that it ſhoulde bee deliuered vnto hir grace downe by a ſilken lace, ſhee cauſed him to ſtay, and ſo paſſed forwarde till ſhee came agaynſte the Aldermen in the high ende of Cheape tofore the little conduite, where the companyes of the Citie ended, which beganne at Fanchurche, and ſtoode along the ſtreetes, one by another enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with rayles, hanged with clothes, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues well apparelled with manye riche furres, and their liuery whodes vpon their ſhoulders in comely and ſeemely maner, hauing before them ſundrye perſons well apparelled in ſilkes and chaynes of golde, as wyflers and garders of the ſayde companyes, beſide a number of riche han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, as well of Tapiſtrie, Arras, clothes of golde, ſiluer, veluet, damaſke, Sattin, and other ſilkes plentifully hanged all the way as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Queenes highneſſe paſſed from the Tower tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Citie.</p>
                        <p>Out at the windowes and penthouſes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery houſe, did hang a number of riche and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banners and ſtreamers, till hir grace came to the vpper ende of Cheape.

The Queenes Maieſtie with both hir hands, tooke the purſe, and aunſwered to him againe maruellous pithily, and ſo pithily, that the ſtanders by, as they embraced entierly hyr gracious aunſwere, ſo they maruelled at the cowching thereof, which was in wordes truely reported theſe. I thanke my Lorde Maior, hys breethre, and you all. And whereas your requeſt is that I ſhould continue youre good Lady and Queene, bee yee enſured, that I will be as good vnto you, as euer Queene was to hir people. No will in mee can lacke, neyther doe I truſt ſhall there lacke any power. And perſwade your ſelues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the ſafetie and quietneſſe of you all, I will not ſpace, if neede be, to ſpend my bloud, God thanke you all. Whiche aunſwere of ſo noble an hearted Princes, if it moued a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſhoute and reioycing, it is nothing to bee maruelled at, ſince both the heartineſſe thereof was ſo wonderfull, and the wordes ſo ioyntly knitte. When hir grace had thus aunſwered the Recorder, ſhee marched towarde the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, where was erected a Pageant with ſquare proportion, ſtanding directly before the ſame conduit, with battlementes accordingly. And in the ſame Pageant was aduanced two hylles or Mountaynes of conuenient height. The one of them beeing on the North ſyde of the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geante, was made cragged, barren and ſtonie, in the whiche was erected on tree, artificially made, all withered and dead, with braunches accordingly.</p>

                        <p>And vppon the ſame withered tree were fixed certayne Tables, wherein were written proper ſentences, expreſſing the cauſes of the decay of a common weale. The other hill on the South ſyde was made fayre, freſh, green, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the ground thereof full of floures and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and on the ſame was erected alſo one tree, very freſhe amd faire, vnder the whyche, ſtoode vpright on freſhe perſonage well apparelled and appoynted, whoſe name alſo was written both in Engliſh and Latin, which was, <hi>Reſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blica bene inſtituta,</hi> a flouriſhing common Weale.</p>

Your petition I gather to be grounded on three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and mine anſwere to the ſame ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in two partes. And for the firſt I ſay vnto you, that from my yeares of vnderſtanding, knowing my ſelfe a ſeruitour of almightie God, I choſe this kind of life, in which I doe yet liue, as a life moſt acceptable vnto him, wherein I thought I coulde beſt ſerue him, and with moſt quietneſſe doe my duetie vnto him. From which my choiſe, if either ambition of high eſtate offred vnto me by mariages (whereof I haue recordes in this preſence) the diſpleaſure of the Prince, the eſchewing the daunger of mine enimies, or the auoyding the perill of death (whoſe Meſſenger the Princeſſe indignation was no little tyme continually preſent before mine eyes, by whoſe meanes, if I knew or do iuſtly ſuſpect, I will not now vtter them, or if the whole cauſe were my ſiſter hirſelfe, I will not nowe charge the deade) coulde haue drawne or diſſwaded me, I had not nowe remayned in this Virgins eſtate wherein you ſee me. But ſo conſtant haue I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continued in this my determination (that although my wordes and youth may ſeeme to ſome hardly to agree togither) yet it is true, that to this day I ſtande free from any other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that eyther I haue had in tymes paſt, or haue at this preſent. In which ſtate and trade of liuing wherwith I am ſo throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, God hath hitherto ſo preſerued mee, and hath ſo watchfull an eye vpon me, and ſo hath guided me and ledde me by the hand, as my full truſt is, he will not ſuffer me to go alone. The maner of your petition I doe lyke, and take in good part, for it is ſimple, and conteyneth no ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of place or perſon. If it had bene other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I muſt haue miſlyked it verie much, and thought in you a verie great preſumption, being vnfitte and altogither vnmeete, to require them that may commaunde, or thoſe appoynt, whoſe partes are to deſire, or ſuch to binde and limitte, whoſe dueties are to obey: or to take vpon you to draw my loue to your lykings, or to frame my wil to your fancies. A guerdon conſtrayned, and a gift freely giuen can neuer agree. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if any of you be in ſuſpect that whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it may pleaſe god to incline my heart to that kinde of life, my meaning is to do or determine any thing wherewith the realme may haue iuſt cauſe to be diſcontented: Put that out of your heades, for I aſſure you (what credence my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance may haue with you I cannot tell, but what credite it ſhall deſerue to haue, the ſequele ſhall declare) I wil neuer in that matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude any thing that ſhall bee preiudiciall vnto the realme: For the weale and good ſafetie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as a good mother of my Countrey, I will neuer ſhooune to ſpende my lyfe. And
<pb n="1778"/>
who ſoeuer my choyſe may lyght vpon, he ſhall be as carefull for the preſeruation of the Realme as you, I will not ſay as my ſelfe: for I cannot ſo certainly promiſe of another, as I doe ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowe of my ſelfe, but as any other can be. And albeeit it doth pleaſe almightie God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue me ſtill in this minde to liue oute of the ſtate of mariage, it is not to be feared, but hee will ſo worke in my heart, and in youre wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, that as good prouiſion may bee made in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> conuenient tyme, whereby the Realme ſhall not remaine deſtitute of an heyre that may bee a fitte Gouernour, and peraduenture more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the Realme than ſuche ofſpring as may come of mee. For though I bee neuer ſo carefull for your well doings, and mynde euer ſo to be, yet may mine iſſue growe out of kinde, and become vngracious.

And the ſame beeing ended wyth ſome likelyhoode, as it ſeemed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that the ſame was muche allowable to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: certaine of the Biſhoppes began to ſaye contrarie to their former anſwere, that they had nowe muche more to ſay to this matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in although they myght haue beene well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for ſuch manner of cauillation, yet for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding of any miſtaking of orders in thys col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie or conference, and for that they ſhould vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that which they had to ſay: It was both ordered, and thus openlye agreed vppon of both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> partes in the full audience, that vpon the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, the Biſhops ſhoulde bring theyr myndes and reaſons in wryting to the ſeconde aſſertion, and the laſt alſo if they coulde, and firſt reade the ſame, and that done, the other parte ſhoulde bring likewiſe theyrs to the ſame. And being read, eche of them ſhoulde deliuer to other the ſame wrytings. And in the meane tyme the Biſhops ſhould put in writing, not onely al that which Doctour Cole had that day vttered: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> all ſuche other matters as they anye otherwiſe coulde thinke of for the ſame, and as ſoone as they might poſſible, to ſende the ſame booke tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that firſt aſſertion to the other part, and they ſhoulde receyue of them that wryting which Maiſter Horne had there read that day, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Monday it ſhoulde be agreed what day they ſhoulde exhibite their aunſwers touching the firſt propoſition. Thus both partes aſſented thereto, and the aſſemblie quietly diſmiſſed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vpon Monday, the like aſſembly beganne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at the place and houre appoynted, and there vpon what ſiniſter or diſordered meaning is not yet fully knowne (though in ſome part it be vnderſtanded) the Biſhop of Wincheſter and his Colleages, and eſpecially Lyncolne, refuſed to exhibite or reade, according to the former no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious order on Fryday, that whiche they had prepared for the ſeconde aſſertion. And therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon by the Lorde keeper of the great Seale, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> being firſt gentlye and fauourably requyred to keepe the order appoynted: and that taking no place, bring ſecondly as it behoued, preſſed with more earneſt requeſt: they neyther regarding the authoritie of that place, nor theyr owne reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor the credite of the cauſe, vtterly refuſed that to doe. And finally being againe particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euerie of them a parte diſtinctly by name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred to vnderſtande theyr opinions therein: they all ſauing one (whiche was the Abbot of Weſtminſter, hauing ſome more conſideration of order and his duetie of obedience than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) vtterly and plainly denied to haue theyr booke read, ſome of them as more earneſtly than other, ſome ſo alſo, ſome other more vndiſcretely and vnreuerently than others. Wherevpon gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch example of diſorder, ſtubbornneſſe and ſelfe will, as hath not beene ſeene and ſuffered in ſuch an honourable aſſembly, beeing of the two eſtates of this Realme, the Nobilitie and the Commons, beſides the preſence of the Queenes Maieſties moſt honourable priuie Counſaile, the ſame aſſembly was diſmiſſed, and the Godly and moſt Chriſtian purpoſe of the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie made fruſtrate.

And immediately by the commandement of the Queenes highneſſe, hir priuie counſaile, tooke order that ſix Citizens of London, and two of the Clergie of the church of Paules, had charge and commaundement to ouerſee and ſet forwarde this worke, who made ſuche expedition, that within one moneth next following the burning thereof, the whole Church, that is to ſay, all the foure great rouſes of the ſame were couered with bourdes and leade, after the maner of a falſe roufe. And the greatneſſe of the worke diſpatched in ſo ſhort tyme coulde fearcely bee credited of any, but of ſuch as ſaw and knewe the ſame. And the cauſe of this great hall was for feare of raine, whiche might haue periſhed the vawtes, to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Churche, and the people that were therein. And before the ſayde yeare was fully ended, all the ſayde Iſles of the ſayde Church were made and framed of newe and maine Tymber, and couered with lead and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed. And the ſame yeare alſo, the greate roufe of the Weſt ende was framed, and made of new &amp; great timber in Yorkſhire, and brought to London by Sea, and ſet vp and couered with lead, and fully finiſhed. And in like maner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſayd yeare, the whole roufe and frame of the Eaſt ende of the ſayde Church was made in Yorkſhyre, and brought by Sea to London, and there ſayde readie to be rayſed when the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the yeare ſerued.
